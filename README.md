## 🔥 About Me

Hi, I’m **Markanti Mithlesh Kumar**, a frontend developer driven by design and obsessed with details. I'm currently exploring cutting-edge tools like **Cursor AI** and **Figma** to boost productivity and creativity.

I believe in:
- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Building fully responsive and accessible layouts
- Designing with both user and performance in mind

I'm actively looking for a **remote internship** in frontend development — let's build something amazing together!
